    "1. **Non-defective Matrix**: The matrix must be non-defective, which means it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. In other words, for an n x n matrix, there must be n linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to n distinct eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diagonalizable Matrix**: The matrix must be diagonalizable, meaning it can be transformed into a diagonal matrix using its eigenvectors. This condition ensures that the eigen decomposition A = P * D * P^(-1) is possible, where P is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\n",

    "1. **Direction Preservation**: An eigenvector of a matrix A represents a direction in space that remains unchanged (up to scaling) under the linear transformation represented by A. When the matrix A is applied to the eigenvector, the resulting vector is a scaled version of the original eigenvector.\n",

    "Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The number of distinct eigenvectors and eigenvalues a matrix possesses depends on its properties and the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of its eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Distinct Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "For some matrices, especially those with distinct eigenvalues, each eigenvalue will have its corresponding unique eigenvector. In this case, the matrix has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors, and each eigenvalue is associated with a unique eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Repeated Eigenvalues**:\n",
    "In certain cases, a matrix may have repeated eigenvalues (also known as degenerate eigenvalues), meaning some eigenvalues have a multiplicity greater than one. This occurs when the characteristic equation results in a repeated root. In such situations, it is possible for a single eigenvalue to have more than one linearly independent eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If an eigenvalue λ has a geometric multiplicity less than its algebraic multiplicity, there will be fewer linearly independent eigenvectors than the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue.\n",

    "**3. Diagonalizable vs. Non-Diagonalizable Matrices**:\n",
    "A square matrix A is diagonalizable if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. This occurs when all eigenvalues have geometric multiplicity equal to their algebraic multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if a matrix is non-diagonalizable, it means that at least one eigenvalue has a geometric multiplicity less than its algebraic multiplicity, resulting in fewer linearly independent eigenvectors than needed for diagonalization.\n",

    "In summary, while a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue depends on the geometric and algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues.
